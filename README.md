## 💫 About Me
As an **AI/ML enthusiast**, I’m passionate about transforming real-world challenges into intelligent solutions.  

🔹 My journey into tech began with a curiosity about how data and models drive smarter decisions—evolving into hands-on experience across the AI/ML stack.  
🔹 I work extensively with **Python** and data science libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** to analyze, visualize, and prepare data for downstream ML tasks.  
🔹 On the AI side, I build **LLM-powered applications** and **AI agents** using **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **Ollama**, and apply transformer models like **BERT** and **FinBERT** via **Hugging Face**.
