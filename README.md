About Me

As an AI/ML enthusiast, I’m passionate about transforming real-world challenges into intelligent solutions. My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how data and models drive smarter decisions—evolving into hands-on experience across the AI/ML stack.I work extensively with Python and core data science libraries like NumPy and Panda to analyze, visualize, and prepare data for downstream machine learning tasks. On the AI side, I build LLM-powered applications and AI agents using tools like LangChain, ChromaDB, and Ollama, and apply transformer models such as BERT and FinBERT through the Hugging Face ecosystem.
